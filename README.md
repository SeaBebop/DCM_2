## DCM Test 2

This project focuses on image analysis and the detection of breast cancer cells using convolutional autoencoders.

### Test Parameters

- Number of Epochs: 150
60
- Batch Size: 24
- Bottleneck Size: 64
- Mass Dataset Size: 493

### Description

In this test run, a convolutional autoencoder was trained with the specified parameters. The DCM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) image type, specifically for breast cancer cells, was used as the dataset.

The purpose of this project is to explore different combinations of parameters and architectures for convolutional autoencoders to improve the accuracy and performance of breast cancer cell detection.

Please note that the success of the model may vary depending on several factors, including the complexity of the dataset, the quality of the data, and the choice of hyperparameters.
